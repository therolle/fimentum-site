## Services Page (How I Help)

### Funding Advisory

**Introduction:**
"Securing funding isn't about filling out forms — it's about aligning your company's actual plans with the right funding instruments, at the right time."

**Description:**
Every funding program operates with distinct logic regarding what it supports, timing, and structure requirements. The service matches business goals and development roadmaps with appropriate funding instruments for current stage and ambitions.

**Process:**
Helps define project scope, timing, and budget so technical, commercial, and financial narratives align with both growth paths and funding body expectations.

**Delivery:**
Once strategy is established, manages application planning, writing, and communication while clients focus on company building.

**Service Areas:**
- Identify suitable funding instruments
- Define project goals, budgets, and work packages
- Write applications designed for quick, efficient funding
- Manage communication and reporting

**Expertise:**
"I do this every day. I keep up with the latest developments and changes in funding instruments. Over 1000 successful applications have taught me what works."

### Financial Planning

**Description:**
"Strong applications need solid numbers. I help you build financial models and project budgets that make sense to funding bodies and investors alike."

**Philosophy:**
Not focused on spreadsheets alone, but rather constructing credible financial narratives.
